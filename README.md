# Uniswap-v3

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive project focusing on liquidity provision strategies for Uniswap v3, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The project has three primary objectives:
1. **Market Analysis**: Gain insights into Uniswap v3's behavior, studying historical data on liquidity pools, trade volumes, and liquidity concentration.
2. **Backtesting Environment**: Develop a robust and independent simulation environment for evaluating and optimizing liquidity strategies.
3. **Strategy Optimization**: Apply deep learning techniques to optimize liquidity provision strategies, focusing on maximizing fees while minimizing risks like impermanent loss.

## Structure
### **Root Directory**
- **`Binance_data_retrieve.py`**: Fetches price data from Binance for comparison with Uniswap's performance.
- **`Burns_script.py`**: Processes historical data on liquidity removal ("burn") events in Uniswap v3.
- **`Collects_script.py`**: Extracts and analyzes liquidity provider fee collection data.
- **`Liquidity_distribution_script.py`**: Constructs and visualizes liquidity distribution across price ranges.
- **`Mints_script.py`**: Handles data on liquidity addition ("mint") events.
- **`Swaps_script.py`**: Analyzes token exchange ("swap") events to compute price and volume changes.
- **`Protocol_fee_script.py`**: Calculates accumulated protocol fees and validates fee distribution mechanisms.
- **`Strat_backtesting_env.py`**: Simulates liquidity provision strategies in a dynamic environment with configurable parameters.
- **`Uniswap_state_script.py`**: Tracks and visualizes the state of liquidity pools over time.
- **`Models_summary.csv`**: Summarizes the performance of various deep learning models used for strategy optimization.
- **`README.md`**: Provides documentation for the repository.
- **`Final Report`**: Contains detailed findings and methodologies of the project.

### **Analysis_Notebooks**
- **`Position_Width_Tradeoff.ipynb`**: Explores the trade-off between position width and fee generation efficiency.
- **`Strategic_NN_LP.ipynb`**: Demonstrates the implementation and performance of deep learning models (e.g., RNN, LSTM) in liquidity optimization.
- **`Stress_Analysis.ipynb`**: Evaluates strategies under simulated stressed market conditions.
- **`Validation_of_Env.ipynb`**: Validates the accuracy of the backtesting environment by comparing simulated results with historical data.

## Key Features
1. **Market Analysis**:
   - Evaluates trade volume trends, liquidity distribution, and impermanent loss patterns.
   - Analyzes market efficiency, comparing price movements on Uniswap with centralized exchanges like Binance.

2. **Backtesting Environment**:
   - Simulates core Uniswap v3 mechanics (e.g., fee generation, liquidity concentration).
   - Tracks liquidity operations dynamically, supporting stress tests for volatile market scenarios.

3. **Strategy Optimization**:
   - Implements deep learning models to predict optimal liquidity ranges and manage risks.
   - Balances fee generation with impermanent loss through advanced mathematical modeling.

## Usage
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Use scripts (`Burns_script.py`, `Mints_script.py`, `Swaps_script.py`, etc.) to fetch and process Uniswap v3 data.
   - Binance data can be retrieved using `Binance_data_retrieve.py` for market efficiency comparison.

2. **Liquidity Simulation**:
   - The backtesting environment (`Strat_backtesting_env.py`) allows testing liquidity strategies under various scenarios.
   - Configure parameters like fee tiers, price ranges, and liquidity amounts.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Use `Strategic_NN_LP.ipynb` to train and evaluate neural network-based strategies for liquidity provision.

4. **Validation**:
   - Validate simulation results using `Validation_of_Env.ipynb` and compare with historical data to ensure accuracy.

## Results
- Simulations confirmed the efficiency of concentrated liquidity strategies in Uniswap v3, balancing trade-offs between fee generation and impermanent loss.
- Deep learning models showed promising results, outperforming baseline strategies in maximizing returns.

## Limitations
- Gas fees are not included in simulations, potentially overestimating returns.
- Some simplifications were made for computational efficiency, which may not fully capture Uniswapâ€™s complexity.

## Future Work
- Incorporate gas fees and other operational costs into simulations.
- Expand the analysis to include additional DEX platforms and alternative liquidity strategies.
